# Algorithms, Part I

This repository contains solutions to assignments for the [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) 
course prepared by Princeton University and shared on Coursera platform.


## Percolation ([code](src/io/github/marwlod/percolation))
**Summary**: Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.

## Queues ([code](src/io/github/marwlod/randomized_queues))
**Summary**: Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue.
 
**Full description**: [here](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)


## Collinear points ([code](src/io/github/marwlod/collinear_points))
**Summary**: Write a program to recognize line patterns in a given set of points.

## 8-puzzle ([code](src/io/github/marwlod/puzzle8))
**Summary**: Write a program to solve the 8-puzzle problem (and its natural generalizations) using the A* search algorithm.

## Kd-Trees ([code](src/io/github/marwlod/kd_trees))
**Summary**: Write a data type to represent a set of points in the unit square 
(all points have x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1) using a 2d-tree to support efficient range search 
(find all of the points contained in a query rectangle) and nearest-neighbor search (find a closest point to a query point).
